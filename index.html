            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Today's presentation will delve into the world of solutions, exploring how the addition of solute particles can impact the properties of the solvent. Solutions often exhibit properties similar to their major component, the solvent, but there are certain characteristics that differ significantly. These unique properties, known as colligative properties, depend solely on the concentration of dissolved particles. Throughout this presentation, we will focus on four important colligative properties: vapor pressure depression, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. By understanding the effects of solute particles on these properties, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of solutions and their practical applications. Let's embark on this journey of discovery and unravel the mysteries of the physical properties of solutions.

        <div id="body">
            <h2>Colligative Properties</h2>
            <p>
                Colligative properties are characteristic of a solution and depend on the ratio of the number of solute particles to solvent particles.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Types of Colligative Properties section -->
        <div id="types-colligative-properties">
            <h2>Types of Colligative Properties</h2>
            <p>
                There are four main types of colligative properties:
                <ol>
                    <li>Vapor Pressure Depression: A decrease in vapor pressure due to the presence of solute particles in the solution.</li>
                    <li>Boiling Point Elevation: The boiling point of a solution is higher than that of the pure solvent.</li>
                    <li>Freezing Point Depression: The freezing point of a solution is lower than that of the pure solvent.</li>
                    <li>Osmotic Pressure: Pressure exerted by the solvent molecules moving through a semipermeable membrane to equalize solute concentrations on both sides.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Vapor Pressure Depression section -->
        <div id="vapor-pressure-depression">
            <h2>Vapor Pressure Depression</h2>
            <p>
                Vapor pressure depression occurs when solute particles are added to a solvent, reducing the tendency of the solvent molecules to evaporate. This results in a lower vapor pressure compared to the pure solvent.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Boiling Point Elevation section -->
        <div id="boiling-point-elevation">
            <h2>Boiling Point Elevation</h2>
            <p>
                Boiling point elevation refers to the phenomenon where the boiling point of a solution is higher than that of the pure solvent. This occurs because the presence of solute particles disrupts the vaporization process, requiring higher temperatures to boil.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Freezing Point Depression section -->
        <div id="freezing-point-depression">
            <h2>Freezing Point Depression</h2>
            <p>
                Freezing point depression is observed when the freezing point of a solution is lower than that of the pure solvent. This happens because the solute particles interfere with the formation of the crystalline structure of the solvent during freezing.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Osmotic Pressure section -->
        <div id="osmotic-pressure">
            <h2>Osmotic Pressure</h2>
            <p>
                Osmotic pressure is the pressure exerted by the solvent molecules as they move through a semipermeable membrane to equalize the concentration of solute particles on both sides. It plays a crucial role in various biological and industrial processes.

            <p>Colligative properties are the physical changes that result from adding solute to a solvent.

            <h3><i><b>Issues concerning this application:</b></i></h3>
            <p> Colligative properties are characteristics of dissolved particles that depend on concentration but not on the nature of those particles. They frequently have an impact on a solvent's melting and boiling points as well as the vapor pressure above a fluid. There are several restrictions you should be aware of even if the production of a solution from a solute and a solvent is not a matter for concern such as;<p>
                    <li>The dissolved substance must not dissociate or associate appreciably.</li>
                    <li>There must be no chemical reaction between solute and solvent.</li>
                    <li>When the solution freezes, the pure solvent alone must separate out.</li>
                    <li>For freezing point depression and boiling point elevation methods the molecular masses of the solution should be very high in order to get reasonable freezing point depressions of boiling point depressions respectively.</li>
